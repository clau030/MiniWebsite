			<h1>Chelsea Lau: Amateur Chef</h1>
            <p>I consider myself a perfectly average cook. My stay-at-home mom often taught me recipes, and from the time I was old enough to be trusted with a kitchen knife, I loved being in the kitchen. I thought cooking was easy and fun, until I moved out on my own and had to shop for groceries and cook for myself 24/7. I learned real quick that cooking gets boring if you're always trying to invent unique recipes.</p>
			  
            <p>Since I'm half Chinese, I like making food that is a lot like me, in a word: fusion. I grew up with a lot of other food influences like Italian, German, Mexican, Middle Eastern, but I always come back to a pot of rice with some vegetables and meat.</p>
			  
            <p>So this website is for people like me, and people drastically different, and people somewhat similar. Pretty much people who want to create new recipes but don't the time or energy to start from scratch. People who want a shortcut for a weekday meal because you're not about to slave over the stove for hours, but you've also already ordered food three times this week. This is for you.</p>
