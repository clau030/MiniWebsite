            <h1>A Website Just About Rice Bowls?</h1>
            <p>Yes! This is only about rice bowls. "But, why?" some might ask. It's because cooking different meals every day of the week is exhausting, and with my tips you can create endless rice bowls that are healthy, easy and never boring. These meals are great for meatlovers, vegetarians, vegans, even those who are <a href="https://www.cahokiarice.com/blogs/health/is-rice-good-for-you-10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-rice#:~:text=Look%20no%20further%20than%20a,also%20help%20to%20reduce%20obesity." target="_blank">gluten-free.</a> The only exception would be the paleo diet, but you can't please everyone.</p>
            <h2>The Formula</h2>

			<p>Much like <a href="https://cookieandkate.com/how-to-make-vinaigrette-plus-variations/" target="_blank">salad vinegrette</a> is a mix of any vinegar, any oil, and any spices, rice bowls are made up of an easy-to-remember formula: Rice, protein, veg, sauce. Obviously rice is the base of the dish, which can be white, brown, or basmati depending on taste and what works best with the other ingredients. For example, white rice seasoned with cumin, lime juice and cilantro fits amazingly with tex mex ingredients like beans and barbecued chicken.</p>
				
			<p>While you can adjust these to your preferences, I will give examples of the ingrediants I've tried and what seems to work the best.</p>

            <p>When deciding what to put in your rice bowl, it's best to choose a kind of theme. The categories I fall back on are tex mex, asian and vegan. For tex mex, this often means mixing cheese, beans, guacamole, salsas, pretty much anything Chipotle offers. With asian rice bowls I like to stir fry different vegetable blends with whatever nuts I have on hand, cashews and peanuts work best. And vegan can be any combination of veggies and herbs, which pair well with a homemade vinegrette or even hummus.</p>
            
			<h2>Experiment!</h2>

            <p>I've given you a road map, but it's important to go out and try things on your own. The best way to come up with a rice bowl recipe is by looking at your leftovers or whatever expires first, and building on top of that. I can't count how many times I've grabbed leftover chicken, a can of corn and an avocado and made a quick burrito bowl. Get creative and get cooking, and if you need a little help, visit the Recipes section of this website.</p>
